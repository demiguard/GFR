Move hardcoded paths to config file
Make every hardcoded url use the django reverse lookup format instead
Make every path an absolute path to avoid alias attacks
Split ris_query_wrapper up so we have a pacs_query_wrapper as well, which handles everything related to PACS
Make functions for adding errors in javascript (potentially assign classes instead of setting css styling directly onto the elements)
Parse csv files into an SQL database for improved performance
Update syntax to conform with PEP8
Update docstrings to have consistent layout
Full cpr checking acording to the protocol specification
Handle incorrect urls; e.g. /fill_study with an invalid RIGS number should redirect to a 404 page
